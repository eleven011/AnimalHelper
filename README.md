# AnimalHelper
This is a project I started in Voice Technologies through PSU. The objective is to help pet owners seek advice on various situations concerning their pets. Currently, this app focuses on symptoms of illness, but I plan to incorporate more behavioral advice as well.

You can ask for advice on a pet (dog, cat, snake, lizard, and birds supported so far; working on rabbits, mice/rats, and more). Check out the PetCondition entity to get an idea of what symptoms I currently support. 

Additionally, I liked the idea of the user being able to make a vet appointment if AnimalHelper recommended such action for their pet. Currently, the user can make a dummy appointment. I plan to flesh this out further to incorporate with Google Calendar. Further down the line, I'd like for this app to locate a nearby vet (or a vet of the user's choosing) and contact the clinic on the user's behalf.

Part of my inspiration for creating this app is that I own a Ball Python. Care for more exotic pets is less talked about and inexperienced pet ownership often leads to poor conditions for said animal. 

My dream for this application (maybe I'll turn this into a mobile app now that I think about it ðŸ˜¹) would be for a user to, for the Ball Python example, tell the app the temperatures, humidity, and other variables of their husbandry, and then AnimalHelper would make detailed recommendations.

Try asking for help with a cockatiel who has swollen feet if you'd like a place to start!
